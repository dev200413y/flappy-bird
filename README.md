Flappy Bird Game
Description
A Python-based implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game using the Pygame library. Players control a bird, navigating it through a series of pipes by flapping its wings to avoid collisions and achieve a high score by passing through pipe gaps.
Features

Welcome Screen: Displays a start screen with a bird, background, and message prompting the player to begin.
Game Loop: Handles bird movement, pipe generation, collision detection, and score tracking.
Random Pipes: Pipes are generated with random gap positions for varied gameplay.
Score Display: Real-time score display using digit sprites.
Sound Effects: Includes sounds for flapping, collisions, scoring, and game over.
Error Handling: Robust asset loading with error messages for missing or corrupted files.

Requirements

Python 3.x
Pygame (pip install pygame)

Installation

How to Play

Run the game:python flappy_bird.py


Press Spacebar or Up Arrow on the welcome screen to start.
Use Spacebar or Up Arrow to flap the birdâ€™s wings and navigate through pipe gaps.
Avoid pipes, ground, or ceiling to continue playing.

File Structure

flappy_bird.py: Main game script.
gallery/sprites/: Sprite images (bird, pipes, background, etc.).
gallery/audio/: Sound effect files.

Game Mechanics

Bird Movement: Gravity pulls the bird down; flapping moves it up.
Pipes: Pairs of pipes (upper and lower) move left, with new pipes added as old ones exit.
Collisions: Game ends on contact with pipes, ground, or ceiling.
Scoring: Points awarded for passing pipe gaps, with sound feedback.

Notes

Runs at 32 FPS with a 289x511 pixel resolution.
Requires all assets in the gallery folder to function.
Includes error handling for asset loading and pipe generation.
